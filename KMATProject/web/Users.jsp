                                        A user can perform tasks based on access granted to different features of the product. 
                                        Typically, any user can view nodes or ladders and concept maps that are shared with him.

                                        A user can be given ownership of a node or ladder or concept map. 
                                        This allows the user to share the structure with other people, add details and 
                                            attach more tools and resources, that are in the system, to the structure.

                                            but are not employees of the organization. 
                                       Upon request, they can be given access to view particular structures and not the complete system.
